# Copilot Instructions for BoxBots 2025

This document provides essential context for AI coding agents working in the BoxBots 2025 codebase.

## Project Overview

This is a C++ project for the 2025 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) season. The project appears to be in its early stages, with initial focus on implementing aiming functionality.

## Project Structure

Current files:
- `aimer.cpp` - Main entry point for the aiming system (early implementation)

## Development Environment

- Language: C++
- Build System: TBD
- Testing Framework: TBD

## Development Practices

As this project is in early stages, key practices and patterns are still being established. This section will be updated as conventions emerge.

## Key Areas for Contribution

1. **Aiming System Implementation**
   - Core functionality will be implemented in `aimer.cpp`
   - Future considerations may include sensor integration and target tracking

## TODO Sections

- [ ] Document build system once established
- [ ] Add testing conventions when implemented
- [ ] Include robot subsystem architecture when defined
- [ ] Document control system patterns as they emerge
